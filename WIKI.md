# Project Summary

The Sports Viewing Finder is a web application designed to help sports fans locate games that they can watch based on their ZIP code. By entering their location, users can see available games across major sports leagues (MLB, NBA, and NHL) and find out where to stream them. This application not only enhances the experience of sports enthusiasts but also addresses the challenges of discovering regional broadcasts and understanding viewing rights. By integrating various data sources, it provides accurate, up-to-date information on game schedules, viewing rights, and regional broadcasting options, ultimately connecting fans with their favorite sports more effectively.

# Project Module Description

The application consists of several functional modules:

1. **User Input Module**: 
   - **ZipCodeEntry**: This component allows users to enter their ZIP code to fetch local teams and viewing options.

2. **Team Selection Module**:
   - **TeamSelector**: Displays teams based on the user's location, enabling them to select their favorite teams.

3. **Game Schedule Module**:
   - **GameSchedule**: Shows a schedule of upcoming games filtered by date and league, allowing users to explore games based on their interests.

4. **Game Detail Module**:
   - **GameDetail**: Provides detailed information about selected games, including teams, dates, times, and viewing options available.

5. **Geographical Viewing Module**:
   - **ViewingMap**: Visualizes where in the United States a game is streamable, indicating available platforms and blackout regions.

6. **Rights Determination Module**:
   - **RightsService**: Integrates viewing rights information to inform users about where they can legally stream each game based on their location.
